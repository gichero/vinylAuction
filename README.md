# Vinyl Auction App
This is my final solo project in coding bootcamp. On 05-17-2017 I built the database schema and set up the frontend and backend requirements by downloading all the npm installments necessary for my application to run. 
vinaylauction.com is an ecommerce site that allows the customer to sign up to the site and place bids on hard to find, first pressing albums
